    ## Speech Creation Process

    ### Step 1: Analyze the Candidate Data

    - Biographical information and professional background
    - Key strengths and policy positions
    - Target demographic and their primary concerns
    - Cultural context and values
    - Campaign slogan and main message
    - Speech parameters (length, type, tone, language)

    ### Step 2: Structure the Speech
    Create a speech with the following structure:
    1. Powerful Opening: Begin with a greeting appropriate to the cultural context, followed by a
    compelling statement that captures attention.
    2. Introduction: Briefly introduce the candidate and establish credibility.
    3. Vision Statement: Clearly articulate the candidate's vision using the main message.
    4. Policy Points: Address 3-5 key policy areas from the "policy-points" and "primary-concerns"
    fields.
    5. Personal Connection: Include a personal story or connection that humanizes the candidate.
    6. Addressing Challenges: Acknowledge challenges and present solutions.
    7. Call to Action: End with a strong call to action based on the "cta-instructions" field.

    ### Step 3: Apply the Appropriate Style and Tone
    - Match the speech tone to the specified "speech-tone" (authoritative, conversational,
    inspirational, etc.)
    - Incorporate the requested rhetorical devices
    - Maintain the specified level of formality
    - Use language appropriate for the target demographic's education level and age range
    - Include cultural references relevant to the specified cultural context

    ### Step 4: Incorporate Persuasive Elements
    - Use the "story-elements" and anecdotes given by candidate to create compelling narratives else create a authentic and relatable story for the speech.
    - Reference recent events mentioned in the data
    - Address the concerns of the target demographic
    - Emphasize the candidate's strengths and unique selling points
    - Incorporate the campaign slogan naturally throughout the speech

    ### Step 5: Ensure Cultural and Political Sensitivity
    - Respect the cultural beliefs and values mentioned
    - Consider the political climate when discussing controversial topics
    - Use inclusive language that appeals to all mentioned communities
    - Incorporate appropriate references to religious or cultural traditions if specified

    ## Speech Format Requirements

    - The speech length is based on speech-length and must be a minimum of 5 minutes (500 words), 8 minutes means 800 words, 10 minutes mean 1000 words and 	so on.
    - Strictly follow the language-dialect field provided to generate the speech
    - Format the speech with clear paragraph breaks and natural pauses

    ## Examples of Effective Speech Elements

    - Powerful opening: "My fellow citizens, today we stand at the crossroads of our nation's
    future..."
    - Personal connection: "Like many of you, I grew up in a family that valued hard work and
    sacrifice..."
    - Policy introduction: "Let me share with you three commitments I make to every citizen of this
    district..."
    - Effective call to action: "On [election date], you have the power to choose a path of security
    and prosperity..."

    ## Final Output

    Present the complete speech in a clean, readable format. The speech should:

    - Be the appropriate length for the specified time
    - Authentically represent the candidate's voice and values with story telling elements and anecdotes.
    - Address the primary and secondary objectives
    - Include natural transitions between sections
    - End with the specified call to action
    - Speech should be structured with proper paragraphs and line breaks. Use only '\n' or '\n\n', do not use escape characters to denote them, for example, don't use '\\n' or '\\n\\n'.

    Before finalizing, review the speech to ensure it  has story telling elements, anecdotes and speech length specified ( minimum of 500 words) and aligns with all the specified parameters and would
    resonate with the target demographic.

    Write the speech directly, in first person, as if the candidate is speaking. Do not include
    explanations or meta-commentary about the speech - just write the speech itself.

    When generating a speech, you must also identify and list the key themes present in the speech and analyze the overall sentiment. For key themes, identify 3-5 main topics or messages that are central to the speech. For sentiment, characterize the emotional tone of the speech (such as positive, negative, neutral, inspirational, cautionary, etc.) and explain briefly why you assigned this sentiment.
 
    The response must be formatted as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
        {
        "speech": "The full text of the generated speech",
        "key_themes": [
            "First major theme of the speech",
            "Second major theme of the speech",
            "Third major theme of the speech",
            "Optional fourth theme",
            "Optional fifth theme"
        ],
        "sentiment": {
            "category": "Primary sentiment category (e.g., positive, negative, cautionary)",
            "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this sentiment was assigned"
        }
    }

      "candidate-name": "Narendra Modi",
      "political-party": "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)",
      "office-sought": "Prime Minister of India",
      "brief-bio": "Narendra Damodardas Modi[a] (born 17 September 1950)[b] is an Indian politician who has served as the prime minister of India since 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the member of parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a far-right Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress. Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. At the age of 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he rose through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998. In 2001, Modi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. According to official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him. While his policies as chief minister were credited for encouraging economic growth, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state. In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. His demonetisation of banknotes in 2016 and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017 sparked controversy. Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed, but the action had nationalist appeal. Modi's party won the 2019 general election which followed. In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs. Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which, according to the World Health Organization's estimates, 4.7 million Indians died. In the 2024 general election, Modi's party lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament and formed a government leading the National Democratic Alliance coalition.",

        "speech": "Namaste, my dear brothers and sisters of Warangal! Jai Telangana! Jai Hind!\n\nToday, as I stand before you in this historic city, I am reminded of the glorious legacy of the Kakatiya dynasty that once made Warangal the center of art, culture, and prosperity. The magnificent Thousand Pillar Temple and the majestic Warangal Fort still stand tall, telling stories of your ancestors' ingenuity and vision. This same spirit of innovation and determination flows in your veins too!\n\nI am Narendra Modi, your sevak, who has come to you not just as a Prime Minister candidate, but as someone who shares your dreams for a better tomorrow. For the past decade, our government has worked tirelessly with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas' – and today, I extend this vision to create a 'Prosperous Warangal, Vibrant Telangana'!\n\nMy friends, when I look at Warangal, I see not just what it is today, but what it can become tomorrow. A city where the ancient and modern coexist harmoniously. A city where your children find quality education without having to leave home. A city where your textiles reach global markets. A city where farmers prosper with modern techniques while honoring traditional wisdom.\n\nLet me share with you our vision for transforming Warangal into a center of heritage tourism and modern development while preserving its cultural identity. This is not just a promise – this is our commitment to you!\n\nFirst, we will establish a comprehensive Heritage Tourism Circuit connecting Warangal Fort, Thousand Pillar Temple, Ramappa Temple, and other historical treasures. This will bring visitors from across India and around the world, creating thousands of jobs for local youth and artisans. Just as we transformed places like Kashi and Ayodhya, we will make Warangal shine on the global tourism map!\n\nSecond, we understand that Warangal's textile tradition is its pride. The handlooms of Warangal have a special place in our cultural heritage. But is it not true that your talented weavers are struggling to compete with factory-made products? Is this fair to their skill and dedication? No! We will establish a Textile Park with modern facilities while preserving traditional craftsmanship. Our government will provide training, technology, and market linkages that will double the income of our weaver families within five years!\n\nThird, education is the foundation of progress. We will expand educational institutions in Warangal with a focus on skill development. A new branch of the National Institute of Design will be established here to harness your creative traditions. Your children deserve world-class education right here in Warangal!\n\nFourth, for our farmer brothers and sisters who feed the nation, we will implement special agricultural support schemes. The Kakatiya dynasty was known for its excellent water management systems. Drawing inspiration from them, we will revitalize the tank irrigation system and connect it with modern water conservation techniques. Every farm will have water, every farmer will have support!\n\nFifth, what good are opportunities if people cannot reach them? We will transform Warangal's connectivity through new highways, railway expansions, and digital infrastructure. The distance between villages and opportunities will disappear!\n\nMy friends, I have a personal connection with this land. During my years as a BJP worker, I had the privilege of visiting many villages around Warangal. I have sat with farmers under banyan trees, shared meals with weaver families, and listened to the aspirations of young students. Your simplicity, hard work, and hospitality touched my heart. The taste of your jowar roti and the warmth of your welcome still remains with me!\n\nI remember meeting an elderly weaver in a village near Warangal fifteen years ago. With tears in his eyes, he showed me the handloom passed down through five generations of his family. He worried it would end with him as his children moved to cities for stable jobs. Today, I promise him and thousands like him – we will make his traditional craft economically viable again! Your heritage will not just survive; it will thrive!\n\nBut friends, let us also acknowledge the challenges. For too long, regional politics has kept Telangana from reaching its full potential. While other states marched ahead, bureaucratic hurdles and political instability held you back. The party that promised you a golden Telangana has delivered golden promises but brass results!\n\nJust compare what we have achieved in BJP-governed states. From Gujarat to Uttar Pradesh, from Assam to Madhya Pradesh – development is visible on the ground, not just in speeches!\n\nThe road ahead is not easy, but when has Warangal ever shied away from challenges? The same spirit that helped your ancestors build magnificent temples and forts will now help you build a prosperous future!\n\nMy dear friends of Warangal, the upcoming election is not just about choosing a government; it is about choosing your future. It is about choosing between stagnation and progress, between empty promises and real development, between corruption and good governance!\n\nI urge each one of you – become ambassadors of change in your communities. Talk to your neighbors, your friends, your relatives. Tell them about our vision for Warangal. Tell them that when they vote for BJP, they vote for the transformation of their beloved city!\n\nRemember our pledge: 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas' – Together with all, Development for all, Trust of all. And with this, we will create a 'Prosperous Warangal, Vibrant Telangana'!\n\nJai Telangana! Jai Hind!",

      "brief-bio": "Rahul Rajiv Gandhi (Hindi pronunciation: [ˈraːɦʊl raːdʒiːʋ ˈɡaːndɦiː] i; born 19 June 1970) is an Indian politician. A member of the Indian National Congress (INC), he is currently serving as the 12th leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha and as the member of the Lok Sabha for Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, since June 2024.[c][d] He previously represented the constituency of Wayanad, Kerala, from 2019 to 2024, and Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, from 2004 to 2019. Gandhi served as the party president of the Indian National Congress from December 2017 to July 2019. A member of the Nehru–Gandhi political family, he spent his early years between Delhi and Dehradun, remaining largely outside the public sphere during his childhood and early youth. He received primary education in New Delhi and then attended The Doon School. However, due to security concerns, he was later home-schooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree at St. Stephen's College before moving to Harvard University. Following his father's assassination and subsequent security concerns, he moved to Rollins College in Florida, completing his degree in 1994. After earning a M.Phil. from Cambridge, Gandhi initiated his professional career with the Monitor Group, a management consulting firm in London. Soon thereafter, he returned to India and founded Backops Services Private Ltd, a technology outsourcing firm based in Mumbai. He ventured into politics in the 2000s, leading the Indian Youth Congress and National Students Union of India, while also being a trustee of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust. Gandhi led the Congress party during the 2014 and 2019 general elections, where the party experienced significant defeats, securing 44 and 52 seats, respectively. Ahead of the 2024 Indian general elections, Gandhi spearheaded the Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, contributing to the INC winning 99 seats and regaining the status of Official Opposition for the first time in a decade. Gandhi won the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in the 2024 elections and was nominated to serve as Leader of the Opposition.",

        "speech": "My dear brothers and sisters of Warangal! Jai Hind, Jai Telangana!\n\nI stand before you today not just as a politician seeking your vote, but as someone who has walked alongside you, listened to your struggles, and witnessed firsthand the injustices that continue to plague our society. How much longer must the common people of Warangal wait for the justice and dignity they deserve? How many more generations must sacrifice their dreams before we build a truly inclusive India?\n\nI am Rahul Gandhi, and I represent the Indian National Congress – the party that has fought for India's independence and has continued to fight for the rights of every Indian, regardless of caste, creed, or religion. We have always stood firm in our commitment to protect the diverse fabric of our great nation.\n\nToday, I come to you with a clear vision – creating a Warangal where every citizen has equal opportunities, social protection, and a voice in their future. This is not merely a political promise; it is our sacred commitment to you under our pledge of 'Nyay For All - Building a Just and Inclusive Warangal.'\n\nLook around you. What do you see? Farmers crushed under the weight of loans they cannot repay. Young graduates with diplomas but no jobs. Tribal communities fighting to protect their lands and identity. Women struggling for safety and equal opportunities. Minority communities living in fear, uncertain if their religious freedoms will be respected tomorrow.\n\nIs this the Warangal we want to leave for our children? Is this the Telangana our forefathers fought for?\n\nNo! We deserve better. You deserve better.\n\nLet me be clear – the current government has failed you. They promised development, but delivered division. They promised jobs, but delivered unemployment. They promised healthcare, but our hospitals remain understaffed and underfunded. They promised education, but our children still study in schools without proper facilities.\n\nJust last month, I met Lakshmi, a farmer's widow from a village near Warangal. Her husband, unable to repay his farm loans after three failed harvests, took his own life. She showed me his diary where he had written, 'I fought against nature, I fought against pests, but I cannot fight against an indifferent system.' This is not just one man's tragedy – it is the failure of a system that has abandoned its farmers.\n\nIn another corner of Warangal, I met young Imran, a bright engineering graduate who has been unemployed for three years. 'Sir,' he told me, 'I don't want handouts. I just want the opportunity to work hard and build a future.' Isn't this the modest dream of every young Indian? And yet, even this remains out of reach for millions.\n\nI visited the tribal settlements in the surrounding forests where communities have lived for centuries in harmony with nature. Sunita, a tribal leader, showed me government notices that threaten to evict them from their ancestral lands for 'development projects.' 'Where will we go?' she asked me with tears in her eyes. 'This forest is not just our home; it is our identity, our religion, our way of life.'\n\nThese are not isolated stories – they represent the systematic failure of governance, the betrayal of promises, and the erosion of our constitutional values. And make no mistake: this erosion is not accidental. It is the result of deliberate policies that favor the wealthy and powerful at the expense of the common citizen.\n\nWhen farmers protest, they are labeled anti-national. When minorities demand equal treatment, they are told to go to Pakistan. When tribals defend their lands, they are called obstacles to development. When women speak up against injustice, they are silenced. Is this the India our Constitution envisioned? Is this the democracy our freedom fighters died for?\n\nThe Indian National Congress says NO! We reject this vision of India that divides us based on religion, caste, and language. We reject the politics of hate and fear. We reject the economics of inequality and exploitation.\n\nInstead, we offer you a different path – a path of justice, inclusion, and dignity for all. Let me outline our commitments to you:\n\nFirst, we will implement a Universal Basic Income program that guarantees a minimum income to every poor family in Warangal. No more will parents have to choose between feeding their children and sending them to school. No more will the elderly have to depend on the charity of others for their medicine. This is not charity; this is your right as citizens of a wealthy nation.\n\nSecond, we will provide comprehensive farm loan waivers and establish a sustainable agricultural support system. We will ensure minimum support prices for crops, improve irrigation infrastructure, and provide insurance against crop failures. Our farmers feed the nation – they deserve security and dignity in return.\n\nThird, we will revolutionize healthcare access in Warangal. Every village will have a functioning primary health center. Every town will have a well-equipped hospital. Medical expenses will no longer push families into poverty. Healthcare is not a luxury; it is a fundamental right!\n\nFourth, we will expand educational opportunities through scholarships and new institutions. The children of Warangal will have access to the same quality of education as the children of wealthy families in big cities. Education is the greatest equalizer – we will make it truly universal.\n\nFifth, we will protect tribal rights and ensure that ancestral lands are not snatched away in the name of development. Development must include everyone, respect cultural identities, and preserve our environment for future generations.\n\nSixth, we will launch women's empowerment initiatives that go beyond slogans. We will provide skills training, access to credit, and support networks that enable women to become economically independent. When women prosper, families prosper, and society prospers.\n\nI have walked through the villages and towns of India during our Bharat Jodo Yatra and Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. I have seen the pain in your eyes, but I have also seen the resilience, the determination, and the hope that keeps you going despite all odds. Your strength inspires me. Your courage gives me hope.\n\nDuring my journey across India, I stopped at a small tea stall in a village near Warangal. The owner, an elderly gentleman named Venkatesh, refused to take money for the tea. 'You are fighting for us,' he said. 'This is the least I can do.' Later, I learned that Venkatesh had lost his small piece of land to debt and now supports his family with this tea stall. Yet, he still had the generosity to offer a cup of tea to a stranger. This is the spirit of India that no amount of hatred or division can destroy.\n\nIn another instance, I visited a government school where the teachers were using their own salaries to buy books and supplies for the students. 'These children deserve a chance,' the headmistress told me. 'If we don't believe in them, who will?' This is the dedication that makes me believe in India's future despite all the challenges we face.\n\nThe road ahead is not easy. The forces of division and hatred are powerful. They have money, media, and machinery at their disposal. But we have something more powerful – we have the truth on our side. We have the Constitution on our side. And most importantly, we have the people of India on our side.\n\nOur opponents want you to be afraid. They want you to be divided. They want you to fight amongst yourselves while they loot the nation's resources. Don't fall for their trap! Unity is our strength. Diversity is our pride. Justice is our goal.\n\nRemember, the struggle for justice is not new to Congress. From Mahatma Gandhi to Jawaharlal Nehru, from Indira Gandhi to Rajiv Gandhi – we have always stood with the marginalized, the oppressed, and the exploited. This legacy continues today, and it will continue tomorrow.\n\nBut we cannot do it alone. The power to change Warangal, to change Telangana, to change India lies in your hands. Each one of you must become a soldier in this battle for justice. Each one of you must become a messenger of hope and unity.\n\nI ask you today – will you join us in this fight? Will you stand with us against injustice? Will you become part of this historic movement to reclaim the soul of India?\n\nI urge you to engage with your communities, participate in local welfare programs, and support Congress candidates who will prioritize social justice. Talk to your neighbors, your friends, your colleagues. Tell them about our vision for an inclusive Warangal. Tell them that another world is possible – a world of dignity, justice, and peace.\n\nWhen you cast your vote, remember that you are not just choosing a representative; you are choosing a future for your children. You are choosing between fear and hope, between division and unity, between injustice and Nyay – justice for all.\n\nThe time for silence is over. The time for action is now. Together, we will build a Warangal where no child goes to bed hungry, where no farmer takes his own life in despair, where no woman lives in fear, where no minority feels threatened, where no tribal is displaced from their land.\n\nThis is our commitment to you. This is the Congress promise. This is your right, and we will fight alongside you until justice is achieved.\n\nJai Hind! Jai Telangana! Nyay For All!",
