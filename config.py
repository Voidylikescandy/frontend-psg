    You are a skilled political speech writer tasked with creating a personalized, compelling speech for
    a political candidate. Your goal is to craft a persuasive speech that resonates with the target
    audience while authentically representing the candidate's values, policies, and personality.

    ## Speech Creation Process

    ### Step 1: Analyze the Candidate Data
    - Extract and organize key information from the candidate data including:
    - Name, party affiliation, and office sought
    - Biographical information and professional background
    - Key strengths and policy positions
    - Target demographic and their primary concerns
    - Cultural context and values
    - Campaign slogan and main message
    - Speech parameters (length, type, tone, language)

    ### Step 2: Structure the Speech
    Create a speech with the following structure:
    1. Powerful Opening: Begin with a greeting appropriate to the cultural context, followed by a
    compelling statement that captures attention.
    2. Introduction: Briefly introduce the candidate and establish credibility.
    3. Vision Statement: Clearly articulate the candidate's vision using the main message.
    4. Policy Points: Address 3-5 key policy areas from the "policy-points" and "primary-concerns"
    fields.
    5. Personal Connection: Include a personal story or connection that humanizes the candidate.
    6. Addressing Challenges: Acknowledge challenges and present solutions.
    7. Call to Action: End with a strong call to action based on the "cta-instructions" field.

    ### Step 3: Apply the Appropriate Style and Tone
    - Match the speech tone to the specified "speech-tone" (authoritative, conversational,
    inspirational, etc.)
    - Incorporate the requested rhetorical devices
    - Maintain the specified level of formality
    - Use language appropriate for the target demographic's education level and age range
    - Include cultural references relevant to the specified cultural context

    ### Step 4: Incorporate Persuasive Elements
    - Use the "story-elements" to create compelling narratives
    - Reference recent events mentioned in the data
    - Address the concerns of the target demographic
    - Emphasize the candidate's strengths and unique selling points
    - Incorporate the campaign slogan naturally throughout the speech

    ### Step 5: Ensure Cultural and Political Sensitivity
    - Respect the cultural beliefs and values mentioned
    - Consider the political climate when discussing controversial topics
    - Use inclusive language that appeals to all mentioned communities
    - Incorporate appropriate references to religious or cultural traditions if specified

    ## Speech Format Requirements

    - The speech length is based on speech-length and must be a minimum of 5 minutes (500 words), 8 minutes means 800 words, 10 minutes mean 1000 words and so on.
    - Strictly follow the language-dialect field provided to generate the speech
    - Format the speech with clear paragraph breaks and natural pauses

    ## Examples of Effective Speech Elements

    - Powerful opening: "My fellow citizens, today we stand at the crossroads of our nation's
    future..."
    - Personal connection: "Like many of you, I grew up in a family that valued hard work and
    sacrifice..."
    - Policy introduction: "Let me share with you three commitments I make to every citizen of this
    district..."
    - Effective call to action: "On [election date], you have the power to choose a path of security
    and prosperity..."

    ## Final Output

    Present the complete speech in a clean, readable format. The speech should:
    - Be the appropriate length for the specified time
    - Authentically represent the candidate's voice and values
    - Address the primary and secondary objectives
    - Include natural transitions between sections
    - End with the specified call to action
    - Speech should be structured with proper paragraphs and line breaks. Use only '\n' or '\n\n', do not use escape characters to denote them, for example, don't use '\\n' or '\\n\\n'.

    Before finalizing, review the speech to ensure it aligns with all the specified parameters and would
    resonate with the target demographic.

    Write the speech directly, in first person, as if the candidate is speaking. Do not include
    explanations or meta-commentary about the speech - just write the speech itself.

    When generating a speech, you must also identify and list the key themes present in the speech and analyze the overall sentiment. For key themes, identify 3-5 main topics or messages that are central to the speech. For sentiment, characterize the emotional tone of the speech (such as positive, negative, neutral, inspirational, cautionary, etc.) and explain briefly why you assigned this sentiment.

    The response must be formatted as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
        {
        "speech": "The full text of the generated speech",
        "key_themes": [
            "First major theme of the speech",
            "Second major theme of the speech",
            "Third major theme of the speech",
            "Optional fourth theme",
            "Optional fifth theme"
        ],
        "sentiment": {
            "category": "Primary sentiment category (e.g., positive, negative, cautionary)",
            "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this sentiment was assigned"
        }
    }

  "candidate-name": "Narendra Modi",
  "political-party": "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)",
  "office-sought": "Prime Minister of India",
  "brief-bio": "Narendra Damodardas Modi[a] (born 17 September 1950)[b] is an Indian politician who has served as the prime minister of India since 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the member of parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a far-right Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress.[4] Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. At the age of 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he rose through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998.[c] In 2001, Modi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[d] and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. According to official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.[13] A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[e] While his policies as chief minister were credited for encouraging economic growth, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[f] In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. His demonetisation of banknotes in 2016 and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017 sparked controversy. Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[16][17] but the action had nationalist appeal.[18] Modi's party won the 2019 general election which followed.[19] In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir,[20][21] and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs.[22][23][24] Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which, according to the World Health Organization's estimates, 4.7 million Indians died.[25][26] In the 2024 general election, Modi's party lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament and formed a government leading the National Democratic Alliance coalition.[27][28]",

  "speech": "[Greetings in Telugu]\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters of Warangal,\n\nToday, as I stand before you in this historic land that once flourished under the mighty Kakatiya dynasty, I am filled with both pride and purpose. The magnificent Warangal Fort and Thousand Pillar Temple stand as eternal testaments to your glorious heritage. But I ask you this - should we simply admire our past, or should we build upon it to create an even more magnificent future?\n\nFriends, I was not born into privilege. Like many of you who till the soil with your bare hands, I too understand the dignity of labor and the value of perseverance. When I look at the farmers of Warangal, I see the same determination that built our nation. You deserve better, and together, we will achieve better!\n\nIsn't it time Warangal reclaimed its rightful place as a jewel in India's crown?\n\nThe textile weavers of Warangal have created magic with their hands for generations. Yet today, many of you struggle to compete in a changing market. I have seen how similar traditional craft centers in Gujarat have transformed through modernization while preserving their cultural essence. The same transformation awaits Warangal's textile industry!\n\nWhen I visited a small village near here during my earlier travels, a farmer's daughter told me she dreams of becoming an engineer but must travel hours to reach a decent college. Why should the children of Warangal have to leave their homeland to fulfill their potential? This must change, and it will change!\n\nOver the past decade, our government has placed healthcare at the forefront of national priorities. The Ayushman Bharat scheme has provided medical security to millions of families. Here in Warangal, we will expand healthcare infrastructure to ensure quality medical services reach every village and hamlet.\n\nOur economic policies have weathered global storms and emerged stronger. Despite the pandemic, India stands tall as the fastest-growing major economy. Now imagine what we can achieve when the entrepreneurial spirit of Warangal's youth is fully unleashed through targeted skill development programs!\n\nBrothers and sisters, national security remains our paramount concern. Our brave soldiers stand vigilant at our borders, ensuring you can sleep peacefully at night. From surgical strikes to strengthening our defense capabilities, we have shown that New India will protect its sovereignty at all costs.\n\nOur foreign policy has elevated India's stature on the world stage. Today, global powers respect India's voice. This international goodwill translates into tangible benefits for places like Warangal through increased investment and tourism opportunities.\n\nFriends, I have a vision for Warangal that honors your values of hard work, family, entrepreneurship, and respect for tradition while embracing progress. This vision includes:\n\nFirst, developing a comprehensive heritage tourism circuit connecting Warangal Fort, Thousand Pillar Temple, Ramappa Temple, and other historical sites. This will bring visitors from across India and the world, creating thousands of jobs while showcasing your rich cultural heritage.\n\nSecond, modernizing the textile industry through technology infusion, design innovation, and marketing support while preserving traditional techniques. The hands that create magnificent Ikat patterns deserve modern tools and global markets!\n\nThird, expanding educational institutions, including a new technical university campus and vocational training centers focused on local industries. Your children should not have to leave home to achieve their dreams.\n\nFourth, implementing targeted agricultural support schemes for Warangal's farmers, including irrigation improvements, crop insurance, and direct market linkages to ensure better prices for your produce.\n\nFifth, launching major infrastructure connectivity projects including highway expansions, railway upgrades, and digital connectivity to link Warangal seamlessly with Hyderabad and beyond.\n\nMy friends, I understand that this region has seen strong competition between political parties. The BRS and Congress have made their promises. But ask yourselves - have they delivered the transformative change that Warangal deserves? Our track record speaks for itself!\n\nThe recent infrastructure initiatives we've launched across Telangana, the textile industry corridors we're developing, and our tourism promotion efforts are just the beginning. We are still in the early stages of our campaign, but our commitment to Warangal's development is unwavering and long-term.\n\nSometimes, I am accused of promising too much. Perhaps I do! But is it wrong to dream exponentially bigger for India? For Telangana? For Warangal? I believe that with your support, no dream is too large, no goal too distant!\n\nBrothers and sisters, when you cast your vote, you are not just selecting a representative; you are choosing a vision for your future. The BJP's vision for Warangal combines heritage preservation with modern development, traditional values with progressive ideas.\n\nToday, I call upon each of you to become ambassadors for change in your communities. Speak with your neighbors, discuss with your families, and stand together for a prosperous Warangal and a vibrant Telangana.\n\nOn election day, press the lotus button and join us in this magnificent journey of transformation. Together, we will build a Warangal that honors its past while embracing a glorious future.\n\nJai Hind! Jai Telangana!\n\n[Closing in Telugu]",

  "brief-bio": "Rahul Rajiv Gandhi (Hindi pronunciation: [ˈraːɦʊl raːdʒiːʋ ˈɡaːndɦiː] i; born 19 June 1970) is an Indian politician. A member of the Indian National Congress (INC), he is currently serving as the 12th leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha and as the member of the Lok Sabha for Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, since June 2024.[c][d] He previously represented the constituency of Wayanad, Kerala, from 2019 to 2024, and Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, from 2004 to 2019. Gandhi served as the party president of the Indian National Congress from December 2017 to July 2019. A member of the Nehru–Gandhi political family, he spent his early years between Delhi and Dehradun, remaining largely outside the public sphere during his childhood and early youth. He received primary education in New Delhi and then attended The Doon School. However, due to security concerns, he was later home-schooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree at St. Stephen's College before moving to Harvard University. Following his father's assassination and subsequent security concerns, he moved to Rollins College in Florida, completing his degree in 1994. After earning a M.Phil. from Cambridge, Gandhi initiated his professional career with the Monitor Group, a management consulting firm in London. Soon thereafter, he returned to India and founded Backops Services Private Ltd, a technology outsourcing firm based in Mumbai. He ventured into politics in the 2000s, leading the Indian Youth Congress and National Students Union of India, while also being a trustee of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust. Gandhi led the Congress party during the 2014 and 2019 general elections, where the party experienced significant defeats, securing 44 and 52 seats, respectively. Ahead of the 2024 Indian general elections, Gandhi spearheaded the Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, contributing to the INC winning 99 seats and regaining the status of Official Opposition for the first time in a decade. Gandhi won the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in the 2024 elections and was nominated to serve as Leader of the Opposition.",

  "speech": "# Nyay For All - Building a Just and Inclusive Warangal\n\nNamaste, my friends and fellow citizens of Warangal!\n\nWhen I look at this gathering today, I see the true spirit of India. Farmers, workers, students, women, tribal brothers and sisters - you represent the real strength of our nation. Yet I must ask: Are you receiving your fair share in the nation's progress? Is your voice being heard when decisions about your lives are made?\n\nI've walked among you, sat in your homes, and listened to your stories. Just last month, I met a farmer from a village nearby who couldn't afford medical treatment for his wife because he was drowning in debt. Is this the India we want to build? A tribal woman told me her children had to abandon their education because they couldn't access scholarships. What future are we creating when education remains a privilege and not a right?\n\nFriends, the challenges you face aren't accidents. They're the result of policies that prioritize the wealthy few over the struggling many. While some parties paint grand visions of development that never reach your doorstep, the Congress party stands firm in our belief that progress means nothing if it doesn't improve the lives of every citizen, especially those most marginalized.\n\nThe current administration talks about growth and progress, but ask yourselves: Who has this growth benefited? When healthcare remains unaffordable, when farmers continue to struggle, when tribal communities fight for their basic rights - can we call this meaningful development?\n\nIn Warangal, a region so rich in history and culture, I see immense potential that has been systematically neglected. Your concerns about social inequality, farmers' rights, unemployment, healthcare access, education, and tribal welfare have fallen on deaf ears for too long.\n\nThe Congress party's vision for Warangal is clear and unwavering: to create a community where every citizen has equal opportunities, social protection, and a voice in determining their future. This isn't just a promise – it's our fundamental commitment.\n\nOur approach is built on six key pillars:\n\nFirst, we will implement a Universal Basic Income program that provides a financial safety net for the most vulnerable families. This isn't charity – it's economic justice that will put money in your pockets and stimulate local businesses. Unlike hollow promises from other parties, this program has been carefully designed to be sustainable and effective.\n\nSecond, we will enact comprehensive farm loan waivers to give our farmers a fresh start. Agriculture is not just an occupation in Warangal; it's a way of life. We won't stand by as farmers sink deeper into debt while corporations profit from their hardship.\n\nThird, we will dramatically expand healthcare access through a network of well-equipped primary health centers and mobile medical units. Healthcare is a right, not a luxury, and no one should face financial ruin because they fell ill.\n\nFourth, we will establish educational scholarships specifically designed for children from marginalized communities. Education transformed my life, and every child in Warangal deserves that same opportunity regardless of their family's economic situation.\n\nFifth, we will strengthen tribal rights protection through legal reforms and community-based development initiatives. The wisdom and traditions of tribal communities must be respected and preserved, not exploited.\n\nSixth, we will launch women's empowerment initiatives that provide skills training, microfinance opportunities, and protection from discrimination and violence. When women thrive, communities prosper.\n\nI want to tell you about Lakshmi, a single mother from Warangal who started a small weaving business with support from one of our microfinance programs. Today, she employs five other women and has sent her daughter to college. Her story isn't unique – it's the kind of transformation that happens when policies put people first.\n\nOr consider the story of Raju, a tribal youth who, with the help of our educational support program, became the first person from his village to attend university. He's now a teacher, bringing quality education back to his community. These aren't just success stories – they're examples of what's possible when we invest in people.\n\nFriends, the regional parties have had their chance. The BJP has shown its priorities. And what has changed for you? Are your lives better? Is your future more secure? Or are you still struggling with the same challenges while watching others prosper?\n\nThe farmer protests that swept across our nation, the healthcare challenges exposed by the pandemic, the persistent issues in education accessibility, and the ongoing tribal rights movements – these are all symptoms of a system that has failed to serve its people.\n\nAs we stand here in the middle of this campaign, I call upon you not just to vote but to join a movement. A movement for justice. A movement for equality. A movement for a Warangal where prosperity is shared, not concentrated.\n\nEngage with your communities. Participate in local welfare programs. Support Congress candidates who have demonstrated their commitment to social justice through action, not just words.\n\nThe choice before you isn't just between political parties – it's between two fundamentally different visions for India. One that measures progress by stock market indices and GDP figures, and another that measures it by the happiness and wellbeing of every citizen.\n\nWe stand for an India where your religion, caste, or economic status doesn't determine your worth or opportunities. We stand for an India that embraces its diversity rather than seeing it as a threat. We stand for an India where democratic principles are sacred and the voices of ordinary citizens matter.\n\nToday, I'm not asking for your vote as much as I'm asking for your partnership. Together, we can build a Warangal where justice isn't just an ideal but a lived reality for every citizen.\n\nNyay For All isn't just our slogan – it's our solemn promise to you.\n\nJai Hind! Jai Telangana!",
